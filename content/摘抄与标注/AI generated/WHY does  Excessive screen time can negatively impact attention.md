title: WHY does  Excessive screen time can negatively impact attention

There are a few reasons why excessive screen time can negatively impact attention, especially in children with ADHD:

**Rapidly Shifting Stimuli:** Screens bombard us with constant changes in visuals, sounds, and information. This rapid fire stimulation can be overwhelming for the developing brain, making it difficult to focus on a single task for extended periods. Children with ADHD already struggle with attention, and screens can exacerbate this by constantly pulling their focus in different directions.

**Reward System Overload:** Screens are designed to be engaging and trigger dopamine release, a neurotransmitter associated with reward and motivation. This constant dopamine hit can make other activities, which require sustained focus and delayed gratification, seem less appealing. For children with ADHD, who may already have an imbalanced reward system, screens can become a crutch for dopamine release, hindering their ability to find motivation in non-screen activities.

**Reduced Practice with Sustained Attention:** The more time children spend glued to screens, the less opportunity they have to develop and strengthen their ability to focus on a single task for extended periods. This is particularly important for children with ADHD who need to practice focusing intently. Activities like reading, playing with non-electronic toys, or engaging in conversations require sustained attention, and less screen time allows for more practice with these crucial skills.

**Sleep Disruption:** The blue light emitted from screens can suppress melatonin production, a hormone that regulates sleep. Inadequate sleep disrupts brain function and cognitive performance, including attention. For children with ADHD, who may already have sleep difficulties, screen time before bed can worsen their sleep quality and further hinder their ability to focus during the day.

**Impact on Working Memory:** Working memory is the brain's temporary storage for information we're actively using. Screens often present information in fragmented ways, with quick cuts and rapid scene changes. This fragmented presentation makes it harder for the brain to process and hold onto information in working memory, which is crucial for tasks like following instructions, completing homework, or engaging in conversations.

These factors all contribute to a negative impact on attention, especially in children with ADHD. By limiting screen time and encouraging activities that promote sustained focus, children can develop stronger attention skills.
